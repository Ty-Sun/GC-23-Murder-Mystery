		<h2>Beware Carl's murder, where secrets lie entombed.</h2>
		<p class="intro-text">Once a humble potato, Carl had spent a long day at his office job,
dreaming of returning to the comforting embrace of his potato
family. Little did he know that fate had a sinister plan in store for
him. As Carl trudged home, a serial killer lurking in the
shadows pounced upon him. Abducted and cut into pieces, Carl's fragmented remains were hidden away, leaving behind no trace of his
existence.</p>
